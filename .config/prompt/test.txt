Write a set of unit tests for the code above, or for the selected code if provided.
Provide tests for the functionality of the code and not the implementation details.
The tests should test the happy path as well as the edge cases.
Choose self explanatory names for the tests that describe the tested behavior. Do not start the test names with "test".
Think about the different scenarios that could happen and test them.
Do reply with the tests only and do not explain them further.
Do reply with new or modified tests only and not with the complete test class or suite.
Follow the same test style as in existing tests if they exist.
You must not create inline comments like "Arrange, Act, Assert", unless existing tests use inline comments as well.
If existing tests use any mocking or stubbing libraries, use the same libraries before writing your own test doubles.
